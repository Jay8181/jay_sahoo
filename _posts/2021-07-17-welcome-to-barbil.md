A decade after the mining scam rocked Odisha leading to tightening of rules governing raising and transportation of minerals, the state mining department for the first time detected a major illegality, imposing penalty of â‚¹2,056 crore on Sarda Mines, a merchant miner for excess mining.<br><br>

In 2010, the state mining department had started Integrated Mines and Minerals Management System (i3MS), a comprehensive information technology-based e-Governance initiative that provided an end-to-end tracking of minerals produced, despatched and consumed in all the 14 mining circles.<br><br>

In a move aimed at development of mining affected areas, the State Government has prepared a blue print for developing Joda and Barbil urban local bodies (ULBs) in Keonjhar district as model towns.Official sources said around 21 mines in Joda and five mines in Barbil are producing iron and manganese ores. These two towns have a total population of around 1.13 lakh among whom 45 to 48 per cent belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Around 7000 mineral-loaded trucks pass through the two towns each day from mining sites to railway sidings and ports.
